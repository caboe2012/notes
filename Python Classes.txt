Using Classes in Python
# More efficient way of creating Classes by using Inheritance
class Musician(object):
    def __init__(self, sounds):
        self.sounds = sounds
    
    def solo(self, length):
        for i in range(length):
            print self.sounds[i % len(self.sounds)]

class Bassist(Musician): # Musician is the Parent of Bassist Class
    def __init__(self):
        # Call the __init__ method of the parent class
        super(Bassist, self).__init__(["Twang","Thrumb", "Bling"])

class Guitarist(Musician):
    def __init__(self):
        # Call the __init__ method of the parent class
        super(Guitarist, self).__init__(["Boink", "Bow", "Boom"])
    
    def tune(self):
        print "Be there in jiffy"
        print "Twoning, sproing, splang"


Getting the class name of an instance in python!  Huzzah!
type("instance").__name__

Counting things using a dictionary
d = []
for key in some_list:
d[key] = d.get(key,0) + 1
